Run an [FRP](https://github.com/fatedier/frp) client during system boot using [Dracut](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dracut_(software)).

Meant for use with [dracut-crypt-ssh](https://github.com/dracut-crypt-ssh/dracut-crypt-ssh) to remotely decrypt a Fedora server that is behind [NAT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_address_translation).
